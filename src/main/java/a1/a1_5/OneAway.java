 * There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a
 * character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit(or zero edits) aways.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * pale,  ple     -> true
 * pales, pale    -> true
 * pale,  bale    -> true
 * pale,  bake    -> false
